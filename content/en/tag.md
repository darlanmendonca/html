## Tag

On HTML, tags are the commands that compound the language.

With these tags give meaning to our content, so that the Browser, or any other web application know process this data. For example, a search engine like Google, need to know what is a title, or what is a paragraph, or an image. To then be able to make a ranking of relevance between what you want and what you have found on pages 

Before we see any tags, we first need to understand how the syntax of html.

First, tags comes from the lowest signal and larger, eg:

```html
<img>
```

Second, most tags have tag pair, ie there for the same tag, the opening tag and the closing tag. In the example below we have a paragraph tag, which in its opening and closing tags, has a content, in this case, the text of paragraph.

```html
<p>Lorem ipsum</p>
```
